## Overview

This app is a MERN stack application for an online wine community. It features the ability to create, edit, read, and delete blog posts, follow friends, and learn from a wine encyclopedia.

## Development Challenges

### Quill Integration
Blog posts are created using Quill, a rich text editor. The development process for Quill was challenging, and some new functionalities could not be added due to a lack of support for Quill v2.

## Routing

Routing is managed via React Router. The routes are organized in a `routerConfig` folder and then consolidated in an index file. The Context API is used for state management when state needed to be outside the local scope.

## Styling

This application is styled using TailwindCSS, providing a modern and responsive design.
